# Conclusion

From this dataset of health insurance customers almost 95% of customers have a vehicle age that's less than 2 years. from our analysis, customers who has more than 2 years of vehicle age are more interested with vehicle insurance advertisment, while customers who has less then one year of vehicle age, only 4% of them are actually interesred with vehicle insurance

We found out that customer who already have vehicle insurance are almost have no interest in another vehicle insurance. Our analysis shows that 99.9% of customers that have a vehicle insurance is not interested in another vehicle insurance, while customer who doesn't have a vehicle insurance 22.5 % of them are interested with vehicle insurance

We also found out that a newer vehicle are more likely to have a vehicle insurance, with vehicle that's less than one year 66% of those are insured , vehicle that's older than one year but less than 2 years are 33% insured, while less than one percent of vehicle that's older than 2 years are insured. This should explain why customer who owns a newer vehicle are less likely to be intersted with insurance promotion, because they probably alredy have one.

Customers who never had vehicle damaged only 0.5 % of those customers are intersted with vehicle insurance, 87% of customers who never had any vehicle damaged already have a vehicle insurance.
